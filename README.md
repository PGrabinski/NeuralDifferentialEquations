Results of my master thesis: Numerical Solution for Differential Equations with Neural Networks

Thesis prepared for the Master of Science degree in Theoretical Physics at University of Wroc≈Çaw.

Based mostly on reproduced publications:
    1. [Lagaris, I., Likas, A., & Fotiadis, D. 1997, Computer Physics Communications,104, 1](https://github.com/PGrabinski/NNDE)
    2. [Shirvany, et. al., "Numerical solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation by feedforward neural networks."](https://github.com/PGrabinski/NNDE_Shirvany)

Other experiments can be found in [the repository](https://github.com/PGrabinski/NNDE_Experiment).

The thesis should be defended as soon as the formalities allow.
